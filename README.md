### $\color{#FF3B30}{\text{⌈ ⚡️ TRANSMISSION ⌋}}$

Open-source first. **Everclaw** connects your OpenClaw agent to the **Morpheus decentralized inference network**—putting models like **GLM-5** (Opus 4.5-level) front and center as your default, with Claude as a fallback only when needed.

Your agent runs on inference you own: GLM-5, GLM-4.7 Flash, Kimi K2.5, and 30+ models powered by **staked MOR tokens** that recycle back to you.

* **No API bills.**
* **No credit limits.**
* **No surprise costs.**

MOR is staked — not spent — so you maintain access for as long as you hold your tokens.
