The **Polymarket UGC League** is a first-of-its-kind creator incubator designed to bridge the gap between niche expertise and viral content.

At its core, the UGC League is about **Incentivized Insight**. Whether you're tracking the 2026 World Cup, analyzing pop culture trends, or predicting financial shifts, the League provides the coaching, community, and capital to scale your voice. Built on the mission of democratizing information, the program turns every headline into a market and every creator into an analyst.
