### Ecosystem Note: YAP (Yield Associated Prediction)
Development is underway for $YAP, a native utility token designed to support the Creator-Fi layer of the prediction market ecosystem. The project aims to facilitate a sustainable environment for high-frequency content creators by implementing a model where 100% of generated fees are redistributed to active creators. This initiative focuses on long-term value for participants who contribute niche expertise to the network's growth.
