♾️ Everclaw — AI Inference You Own, Forever
Powering Your OpenClaw Agents

Open-source first. Everclaw connects your OpenClaw agent to the Morpheus decentralized inference network — putting open-source models like GLM-5 (Opus 4.5-level) front and center as your default, with Claude as a fallback only when needed.

Your agent runs on inference you own: GLM-5, GLM-4.7 Flash, Kimi K2.5, and 30+ models powered by staked MOR tokens that recycle back to you.

No API bills.
No credit limits.
No surprise costs.

MOR is staked — not spent — so you maintain access for as long as you hold your tokens.
